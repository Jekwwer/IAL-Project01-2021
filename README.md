# IAL-Project01-2021

Solution for the 1st homework assignment from the subject _'IAL (Algorithms)'_ for the academic year 2021/22 at VUT FIT. \
Řešení 1. domácího úkolu z předmětu _'IAL (Algoritmy)'_ pro akademický rok 2021/22 na VUT FIT.

## Task: Homework Assignment #1

**Exercises:**

1. **C202:** Implement a character stack using an array. (3 points)
2. **C204:** Convert infix mathematical expressions to postfix format. (3 points)
3. **C206:** Create a doubly linked linear list. (4 points)

**Instructions:**

-   Complete the functions in `c202.c`, `c204.c`, and `c206.c`.
-   Submit the aforementioned files through IS FIT in UTF-8 encoding.
-   Check your implementations with provided testing applications (e.g., `c202-test.c`).
-   Compilation scripts are available: `make all`, `make clean`, `make run`.
-   **Do not** modify the function headers or pre-prepared header files.

**Grading:**

-   Gain 2 points per exercise if your implementation passes basic tests on the server `eva.fit.vutbr.cz`.
-   For correct outputs under advanced tests, earn the remainder of the points (1 each for C202 and C204, 2 for C206).

**Recommendations:**

-   Consider enhancing the basic testing application to identify errors.
-   Focus on fully solving one or two exercises rather than partially attempting all if time is limited.

**Important Notices:**

-   Assignments are auto-graded on `eva.fit.vutbr.cz`.
-   Non-compliance or modifications to the given task will result in zero points.
-   Non-compilable or infinite-looping exercises get zero points; exercises running over 15 seconds will be terminated.
-   Ensure individual work. Plagiarism or unauthorized collaboration may lead to disciplinary action.
